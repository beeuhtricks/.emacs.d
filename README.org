# .emacs.d
This is my personal emacs config. I have tried many times to use other folks' emacs 
setups and have decided to forge my own as a result of those experiences. It currently
contains minor modifications for org-mode, tuareg, and a few other packages for
functional programmming in OCaml and theorem proving. As I move on to other languages,
I will add my configurations for them.
